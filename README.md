# Data_science_salary_pred_proj
This model predicts the salary of Data scientist and other similar jobs such as MLE, Data Engineer, Research scientist of US.

### Skills Used in this project
1. Machine Learning
2. Python
3. Web Scrapping
4. model production using Flask API

In this project, I build a linear model that predicts the salary of Data Science job in US. for this I used glassdor job search website for webscrapping.
and apply some machine learning algorithms like random forest, SVM, multiple linear regression.
